## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of **10 folders**, each representing a different class of tomato leaf condition:

1. **Tomato Bacterial Spot**
2. **Tomato Early Blight**
3. **Tomato Healthy**
4. **Tomato Late Blight**
5. **Tomato Leaf Mold**
6. **Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot**
7. **Tomato Spider Mites (Two-Spotted Spider Mites)**
8. **Tomato Target Spot**
9. **Tomato Mosaic Virus**
10. **Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus**

Each folder contains numerous labeled images used to train the CNN model.

## üß† Model

The classification model is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented in Python via Keras/TensorFlow. The model includes:

- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Convolutional and max-pooling layers
- Dense layers for classification
- Training and validation analysis
